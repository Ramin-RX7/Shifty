# Classes (Types)

All classes inherit from default `type` class that is already implemented in the language.





In order to be displayed in the output, classes should implement `str` method. This method **should** return string

Default implementation for `str` method returns `${objectType}::${objectId}`  (implemented in `type` class)


## Special methods

Special methods are inspired by python magic methods.
These methods implement extra bits to objects.
> These are defined in the [SpecialMethods.md](/docs/principals/Classes/SpecialMethods.md)
