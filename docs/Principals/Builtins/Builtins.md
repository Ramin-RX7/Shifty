# Builtins

This section of the docs covers the builtins in the language.

As there are several types of language-specific parts in this section, they are all separated into their own doc.

1. [Primitive types](/docs/Principals/builtins/primitive_types.md):  Simple data types that most of other types are built upon these.
2. [Composite types](/docs/Principals/builtins/composite_types.md):  Other data types that are a bit more complex than primitive types.
3. [Functions](/docs/Principals/builtins/functions.md): functions that are predefined by the language
4. [Factories](/docs/Principals/builtins/factories.md): different features of language that let users make their own data types.


Builtins may have more control over the objects and can have their own structure of `objects mapping`.
