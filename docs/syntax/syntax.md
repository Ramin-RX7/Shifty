> language grammar, lexer and parser are considered as part of `syntax` documentation.

As of now, `ANTLR4` is considered to be used as lexer of the language since it's a feature-rich and flexible lexer (and parser).\
Multiple language support, IDE integrations and ready-to-use grammar of ANTLR can improve the development speed for syntax and AST. However this does not mean that it will be used forever. The performance and memory consumption might not be satisfying and lead to a handcrafted lexer/parser. But for now, the best choice that helps us move on to the next phase and skip unimportant parts (for now) is `ANTLR4`.
