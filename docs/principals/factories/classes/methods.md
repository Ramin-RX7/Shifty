# methods

Methods of a class are separated into two main categories:

1. Instance methods:  These methods can only be called from an instance of the class
2. Class methods:  These methods are associated with the class itself rather than instances (must be called from class name)


## Special methods

Special methods are related to instance behavior in more general purposes.
These methods implement extra bits to objects.

> They are documented in [SpecialMethods](/docs/principals/factories/classes/special_methods/special_methods.md)
